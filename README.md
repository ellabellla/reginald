# WORK IN PROGRESS
# Reginald: A from scratch Regular Expression Engine

A very simple regular expression engine written in rust.  

## How it Works

1. A regular expression is inputted as a string into a Lexer

2. The Lexer generates a stream of tokens from the string

3. The parser validates and generates an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the token stream

4. The AST is compiled into a non-deterministic finite state machine

5. Input is given to test against the regular expression

6. The state machine is simulated with the input to determine if a string is apart of the language the regular expression defines

## The State Machine

### States

| State  | Description                                                                                                |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Symbol | Any character that is the same as the states character will be matched and the state machine will continue |
| Any    | Any character will be matched on this state and the state machine will continue                            |
| Set    | Any character in the set will be matched and the state machine will continue                               |
| NotSet | Any character not in the set will be matched and the state machine will continue                           |
| Accept | A ending state for the state machine                                                                       |
| None   | Used as a connected point between states and is otherwise ignored when simulating the state machine.       |

## Syntax
